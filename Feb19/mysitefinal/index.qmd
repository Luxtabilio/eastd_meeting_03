# Welcome to My Academic Space

I'm Kien Le, a scholar in Buddhist Studies currently working on my MDiv at Harvard Divinity School. My academic work focuses on the intellectual history of Buddhism, particularly early canonical traditions, sectarian developments, early Mahāyāna thought, and the transmission of Buddhism into China.

## My Focus

My methodological approach emphasizes hermeneutic flexibility—understanding Buddhist texts and doctrines within their own intellectual, literary, and soteriological contexts. I also explore practical applications of Buddhist therapeutics in contemporary medical and psychotherapeutic contexts.
