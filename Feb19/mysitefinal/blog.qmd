# Reflections on Buddhist Studies

Welcome to my research blog where I share insights, reflections, and explorations in Buddhist intellectual history, early canonical traditions, sectarian developments, and early Mahāyāna thought. I also explore the practical applications of Buddhist therapeutics in contemporary medical and psychotherapeutic contexts. These posts represent ongoing inquiries and scholarly reflections rather than final conclusions.
